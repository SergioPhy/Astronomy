#Write a crossmatch function for two catalogues to within a maximum radius. The catalogues are 2D NumPy arrays of RA and declination in degrees.

#Your function should convert all the coordinates to radians before it starts crossmatching. It should return 3 values:

#A list of tuples of matched IDs and their distance in degrees;
#A list of unmatched IDs from the first catalogue;
#The time taken (in seconds) to run the crossmatcher.
#Both catalogues are given as an NÃ—2 NumPy array of floats. Each row contains the coordinates of a single object. The two columns are the RA and declination.

#An object's ID is the index of its row, starting at 0. Your function should work with input catalogues with any number of objects.

# Write your crossmatch function here.
